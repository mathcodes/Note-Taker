## Description

This project allows users to create, store, and delete notes as they wish. It introduces concepts using the basic languages (HTML5, CSS3, and JS) but builds on these using NodeJS and Express in order to create routes between the servers and clients. Its a great tool for learning how the back-end meets the front-end.
